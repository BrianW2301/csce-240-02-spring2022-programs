This project relies on using the jsoup library in the lib folder as a reference library

First, the program checks if the input argument matches a valid district. (Only 46 is valid).
Then the program uses methods from the jsoup library to load an HTML file as a document and search for specific elements using their JS Path as a key.
The program then retrieves the text from each element and prints it to an output file
