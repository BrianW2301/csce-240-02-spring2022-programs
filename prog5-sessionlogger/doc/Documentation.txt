This program uses a "Representative" class, and it's information comes from the 3 data classes: PersonalInformation, ContactInformation, and CommitteeAssignments.
The data for the data classes comes from the DataLoader class, which is a modified version of program2-processor.
The DataLoader uses static methods to scan a text file similar to what would be output from prog1-extractor and send hashmaps of data to the data classes.
In the ui loop, the program compares each user input against all possible predefined inputs and assigns a confidence level between 0 and 1 for each input.
If the highest confidence level is greater than or equal to 0.5, then the programs responds to that input accordingly.
If the highest confidence level is below 0.5, the corrosponding prompt is displayed, and the user is told to rephrase their question
The program stops when the user enters "quit" or 'q'
