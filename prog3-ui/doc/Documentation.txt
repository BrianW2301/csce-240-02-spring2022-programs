This program uses a "Representative" class, and it's information comes from the 3 data classes: PersonalInformation, ContactInformation, and CommitteeAssignments.
The data for the data classes comes from the DataLoader class, which is a modified version of program2-processor.
The DataLoader uses static methods to scan a text file similar to what would be output from prog1-extractor and send hashmaps of data to the data classes.
In the ui loop, the program looks for specific predetermined phrases and gives an output relative to the phrase.
All other inputs are met with a message saying "I do not know this information".
The input is not case sensitive and if the user adds a '?' to the end of their question, it is handled.
The program stops when the user enters "quit" or 'q'
